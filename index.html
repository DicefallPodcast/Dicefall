      <h3>A D&D 5E Live Podcast</h3><br>
      <p>
        A 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons real play podcast. Anyone is welcome to enjoy our games but we mainly created this podcast for the fun of re-listening to our own game sessions. These episodes are a full recordings of our weekly D&D game session. We don't do much sound adjustments or editing. We are also adults and an occasional swear may slip out.
<br>


The first campaign, Vengeance of the Lost, is set in the world of Ethea. This is a home brew campaign.<br>

The second campaign is an adaption of Tyranny of Dragons. I am adding some content and this version has 3 moons - Iustitia, the white moon (good), Aequalis, the red moon (neutral) and Infortunii, the black moon (evil) - that affect the magic in the world.
